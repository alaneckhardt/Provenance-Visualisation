# About
The Provenance Visualisation is a javascript library for visualising provenance records. It uses several other libraries and CSS to create the graph as nice as possible.

It uses [Provenance Service](https://github.com/alaneckhardt/Provenance-Service) to communicate with the server. Currently, Provenance Service is using OPM, but in future, support for PROV-O will be implemented as well.

#Documentation 
The basic documentation is on the Github [wiki](https://github.com/alaneckhardt/Provenance-Visualisation/wiki), otherwise contact the author at : a.e@centrum.cz

#Demo 
The demo for visualisation can be accessed here:
[http://mrt.esc.abdn.ac.uk:8080/ourspaces/testProvenance/provvisdemo.jsp](http://mrt.esc.abdn.ac.uk:8080/ourspaces/testProvenance/provvisdemo.jsp)

It shows a provenance of an interview - two agents controlling it, one involved in and a recording that was generated by the interview and a focus group artefact that was used by the process.
It is a demo of the visualisation only - the editing of the provenance is not allowed.
