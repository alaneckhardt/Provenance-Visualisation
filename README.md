# About
The Provenance Visualisation is a javascript library for visualising provenance records. It uses several other libraries and CSS to create the graph as nice as possible.

It uses [Provenance Service](https://github.com/alaneckhardt/Provenance-Service) to communicate with the server. Currently, Provenance Service is using OPM, but in future, support for PROV-O will be implemented as well.

#Documentation 
The basic documentation is on the Github wiki, otherwise contact the author at : a.e@centrum.cz
